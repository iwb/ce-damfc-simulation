## Introduction
This repository provides a modular simulation framework for evaluating Material Flow Control (MFC) strategies in disassembly systems. The framework enables researchers and production planners to assess and compare various pool sequencing and shop floor dispatching rules for disassembly operations. The tools include:

- ‚úÖ has been **verified** for the scenarios described in the paper (9 rule combinations, 70 orders)
- ‚úÖ **correctly implements** the LUMS-COR mechanism and dispatching rules
- ‚úÖ **produces reproducible results** for the published experiments
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **makes specific assumptions** - see [LIMITATIONS.md](./LIMITATIONS.md)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **may require modifications** for different use cases


### Components
The framework includes:
1. **DAMFC Core Framework**: a Python-based discrete event simulation that uses SimPy to model disassembly systems with stochastic processing times and uncertain product conditions
2. **LUMS-COR Implementation**: Lancaster University Management School Corrected Order Release mechanism with Planned Completion at Workstation (PCAW) calculations for workload control
3. **Visualization Tools**: bar charts for analyzing simulation results

### Abstract
Due to the trend towards a circular economy, the efficient management of end-of-life products and disassembly has become more important. This repository provides a modular simulation framework for evaluating and comparing various production control strategies in disassembly systems. The framework integrates and evaluates different material flow control methods, including the Lancaster University Management School Corrected Order Release (LUMS-COR) approach and various pool sequencing and shop floor dispatching rule combinations. Key performance indicators such as resource utilization, throughput time, and profitability can be assessed, enabling the evaluation of the effectiveness of a chosen combination of pool sequencing and shop floor dispatching rules.

### System Architecture

The framework implements a modular architecture with several core components.

    <br>
    <em>Figure 1: System architecture showing the interaction between core components</em>
  </figure>
</div>

**Core Components:**

1. **Configuration Layer** (`appConfig.py`)
   - reads disassembly process plans from the `input/` folder
   - defines system parameters, such as workload norms, and dispatching rules
   - configures the simulation environment

2. **Control Layer** 
   - `OrderReleaseControl`: implements the LUMS-COR mechanism with pool sequencing rules
   - `PreShopPool`: manages the order queue and release decisions
   - `OrderGenerator`: creates orders based on stochastic arrival patterns

3. **Execution Layer**
   - `MainSimulation`: orchestrates the simulation execution
   - `WorkStation`: processes tasks according to dispatching rules
   - `Warehouse`: stores completed components

4. **Analysis Layer** </br>
Note: This layer is not visualized in Figure 1. The calculation is done by accessing the generated data from the system (architecture).
   - `kpiTracker`: calculates performance metrics
   - `loggerConfig`: records detailed event logs for analysis and verification
   - `processCSV`: generates summary reports

<!-- USAGE INSTRUCTIONS -->
<!-- ================================================== -->
## Usage Instructions
> Before running simulations, please review the [LIMITATIONS.md](./LIMITATIONS.md) file to understand the tested parameter ranges and assumptions.

### Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iwb/ce-damfc-simulation.git
   cd disassembly-mfc
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Quick Start
The framework can run in three modes:

#### 1. Run All 9 Scenarios (Default)
This mode executes all nine rule combinations as outlined in the research article.
```bash
python run_simulation.py
```

This runs the complete set of scenarios:
- Simulation1: FCFS + FCFS
- Simulation2: FCFS + SPT
- Simulation3: FCFS + PST
- Simulation4: CR + FCFS
- Simulation5: CR + SPT
- Simulation6: CR + PST
- Simulation7: EDD + FCFS
- Simulation8: EDD + SPT
- Simulation9: EDD + PST

#### 2. Run Single Simulation
It is possible to run a single simulation using the rules configured in `damfc/appConfig.py`.
```bash
python run_simulation.py --single
```

Before running in single mode, configure your desired rules in `damfc/appConfig.py`.
```python
POOL_SEQUENCING_RULE = "CR"   # Options: "FCFS", "CR", "EDD"
DISPATCHING_RULE = "SPT"      # Options: "FCFS", "SPT", "PST"
```

#### Pool Sequencing Rules (Order Release)
- **FCFS** (First-Come-First-Served): orders are released in arrival sequence
- **CR** (Critical Ratio): priority is based on (time remaining)/(processing time)
- **EDD** (Earliest Due Date): orders with the earliest due dates are released first

#### Dispatching Rules (Shop Floor)
- **FCFS** (First-Come-First-Served): tasks are processed in the order they arrive at the workstation
- **SPT** (Shortest Processing Time): shortest tasks are processed first
- **PST** (Planned Start Time): tasks are dispatched based on backward scheduling from the due date

#### 3. Testing
For quick testing with reduced complexity, use the test module.
```bash
cd damfc
python test.py
```

This runs a simplified scenario with:
- six orders (instead of 70)
- 20 time units (instead of 100)
- single instance per workstation type
- deactivated bar charts

### Configuration
In addition to selecting pool sequencing and dispatching rules, other system parameters can be adjusted in `damfc/appConfig.py`.

```python
# System Parameters
WORKLOAD_NORM = 10             # Workload threshold (WIP limit)
SIMULATION_TIME = 100          # Total simulation duration
TOTAL_ORDERS = 70              # Number of orders to generate

# Order Generation
INTER_ARRIVAL_TIME_MEAN = 0.648  # Mean time between order arrivals
DUE_DATE_RANGE = (40, 50)        # Random due date range

# Workstation Configuration
STATION_TYPES = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
STATION_INSTANCES = {'A': 2, 'B': 2, 'C': 2, 'D': 3, 'E': 1}
```

## Visualization
After the simulation run is complete, the **Event Log Explorer** and **Results Viewer** are automatically displayed.

### Event Log Explorer
An Interactive log viewer with search and filter capabilities

  </figure>
</div>

**Features:**
- **Chronological View**: events are sorted by timestamp
- **Search/Filter Capability**: 
  - find specific order IDs by entering an order ID (e.g., "O-11")
  - filter by station ID (e.g., "B-1")
  - search event types (e.g., "task complete")
- **Double-Click Details**: click any row to view complete order information

### Results Viewer
Closing the Event Log Explorer opens the "Combined Simulation Results" window, which presents the simulation results in a tabbed interface with three main components.


**1. KPI Table Tab**</br>
Table displaying comprehensive performance metrics
- information and metrics shown:
  - **Rules**: pool sequencing and shop floor dispatching rule combination (e.g., "FCFS + SPT")
  - **Total Orders**: number of orders generated and processed during the simulation (default: 70)
  - **Workload Norm**: applied threshold for order release
  - **Overdue Orders**: count of orders exceeding due dates
  - **Unfinished Orders**: orders not completed within the simulated time
  - **Throughput Time Mean**: average time for orders to be completed
  - **Idle/Work Time**: cumulative times across all workstations
  - **Net Profit**: revenue minus process costs
- includes an adjustable font size slider for better readability

### Customizing Process Plans
To add custom disassembly process plans:

1. create a new JSON file in `input/` following the structure of existing plans
2. reference it in `damfc/appConfig.py`.
   ```python
   with open('input/custom_plan.json') as file:
       CUSTOM_PLAN = json.load(file)
   ```
3. update the OrderGenerator class to include the new plan
